# ndxstr

This is a desktop app that connects to lots of Nostr relays and saves events to a MySQL database.

* Desktop app stuff: [Tauri](http://tauri.app/)
* Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite
* Backend: Rust

Super pre-alpha, not quite ready for others to use.

You can follow along with our development in the [Building Arc](https://thearcapp.com/videos) video series starting in [video 38](https://thearcapp.com/video/38) where we discuss the need for an event indexer for [Arc](https://thearcapp.com).
