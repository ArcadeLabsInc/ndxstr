# ndxstr

Let's build a Nostr event indexer in TypeScript and Rust using [Tauri](http://tauri.app/).

This is a desktop app that connects to lots of Nostr relays and saves events to a MySQL database.

Super pre-alpha, not quite ready for others to use.

You can follow along with our development in the [Building Arc](https://thearcapp.com/videos) video series starting in [video 38](https://thearcapp.com/video/38).
